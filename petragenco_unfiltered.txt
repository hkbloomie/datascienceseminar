Please stop this. Women already criticise their bodies and looks too much.
For health reasons we should think about our belly but new studies also show that when we get older, it is better to have a little overweight instead of being too skinny. Obs little overweight, obesitas is not good.

Hi Petra. Just signed up for 7 day challenge. I’m 56 and do weight training twice a week and Pilates twice a week, play the drums so gigging is a good work out! Hoping to rid my belly fat that I can’t seem to shift so following the 7 day challenge and reducing carb in take. I am pretty active here in Melb, Oz on a couple of acres so don’t sit down much apart from my 3 days of admin work! I’m pescatarian and eat well but definitely indulge in bread so will reduce that! Thanks for the motivation. I’m on it thanks also to @charlottestuart99 for finding Petra for me ❤

Why can’t people just stop pretending to want to help and just come right out and say what it is that needs to be done or eaten or stopped instead of taking already frustrated people through these guessing games “click here”, “sign up here”, “free trial here”, “guess what I did, read on”… I’m sooo sick of it!!! If you’re selling something, then say that- and also back up that it is safe, that it works, and what the out-the-door costs are. Stop acting like you’re in it to save humanity!!!!
