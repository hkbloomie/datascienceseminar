I understand the point being made and I agree with it, so many people have been found to be fake. But truth is, there are women who are naturally built like an hour glass, pear shape or coke bottle. Everyone should just be appreciative of what they have and not try to be like the next person, but instead strive to be the best version of themselves. Insecurities both exist in those who are naturally built like the edited example in this video and those who are built like the unedited. Nonetheless, both bodies are beautiful. This comment is for those who really think the hour glass physique is fake. Remember bbls and edits are mimicking natural bodies.

I believe balanced life is the lifestyle everyone should consider. Too much fat or too less fat is never healthy. Talking about esthetics its not only because in my opinion it looks healthier but also because its a risk for you organs, hormones, mood, etc if you do the extremes. Extreme low fat% is only fine when you close to a bodybuilding contest.

Finding that balance is key. It's refreshing to see a reminder that health is about more than just strict rules. 😊

What is crazy is that I cut down on sweets/sugar and oh my goodness when I eat one or anything….way too much
I dislike Krispy Cream donuts. Also, I had kool-aid for the first time in years. Let me tell you…I was like wooooaahh I don’t remember it tasting like this.
However, I will eat those conchas haha

It’s true that our taste buds change throughout life. I can now eat pickles with sandwiches, of course a specific kind.

When I was a trainer I told this to my clients all the time! All these damn diet restrictions are making an unhealthy mental mindset about food. And 80/20 all the way! I’m even for 70/30 sometimes because it’s that time of the month. Lol anyone reading this….if you’re into fitness…fit this donut, cake, ice cream in your mouth girls! Just not all the dang time is all. It’s ok really. Here’s food for thought….only one workout is not going to make a difference in your end goals, just like one sweet treat isn’t going to make a difference either. If you totally cut out all sugars I guarantee you will crash and go ham later. But it’s ok, don’t take our word for it. See for yourself.

I'm seeing this and thinking up weird combos like how well doughnut- flavoured broccoli would go down 😂

I love your ig and I follow u for a while but sorry, u can’t qualify a donut as “food”, I get your point but I think it would be better to compare it with a homemade sweet snack instead. Even is not good to eat broccoli always, broccoli still being food while donuts are just literally sugar poison.. they should never be eaten even we all do.. hope I make myself understand, no offence just trying to make my point 🙌❤ love ur content though

You can eat broccoli everyday and be ok, now if you said only broccoli and nothing else ok fine. Also you cannot eat a donut everyday without there being consequences due to its ingredients so how is a donut good for you? 😄 I get your message balance is key but this is extremely misleading for the uneducated ppl

That doesn't make the donut healthy 😂 it's still not healthy, just not an issue in moderation. 😂

80/20 is not a good split depending on what you are eating. That donut for example is probably 500cal minimum. If you eat 1 of those per day your taking in a lot of extra calories. Now if you every once in a while you have a donut yeah that's cool.
