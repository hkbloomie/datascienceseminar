Question, trying to gain here too, but how are you dealing with the addition of body fat? I’m trying to limit mine as much as possible, but it seems a little inevitable.

fitwithniamh_'s profile picture
@ggfinley it is kind of is inevitable that you will gain some body fat in the gaining process depending on your genetics, I certainly have which is why after I bulked I have started to increase my expenditure abit more to cut that body fat whilst maintaining muscle mass. However, you can still gain and keep body fat % lower by eating high protein meals & bulking them out with veggies & healthy fats & of course your carbs too. You can keep your daily expenditure somewhat higher too it just will be a longer process than a strict bulk with little to no cardio xx
